# CS320-Journal

This repo shows some of the backend work I did in CS 320. For Project One, I included the full contact service setup: Contact.java, ContactService.java, and the JUnit tests for both. For Project Two, I added my final summary and reflection. Together, these files show how I approached testing, automation, and making sure the backend actually works the way it’s supposed to. The biggest thing was writing unit tests that cover both normal use and all the edge cases. I added checks so things like null values or invalid phone numbers would throw errors right away. I also made sure that any object coming out of the service was a copy, so nothing could get changed by accident. If something wasn’t supposed to be allowed, the code threw an exception. It wasn’t just about passing tests—it was about making sure bad data never made it into the system in the first place. I just followed the rules we were given and made sure the code backed them up. For example, if a contact ID had to be exactly 10 characters, I added a length check that throws if it’s too short or too long. Same thing with phone numbers and descriptions. Once I had that logic in place, I wrote tests that tried to break it. The service layer made it easy to work with the data safely while still letting me test all the ways users might mess it up. I start simple: what’s the object, what’s it supposed to do, and what can go wrong? Then I build from there. I like to write the tests as I go so I know each part works before moving on. I keep the logic tight inside the object classes, and use the service class to handle anything outside of that. Overall, I try to write code that’s easy to fix if something breaks, and easy to test if I ever need to update it.
